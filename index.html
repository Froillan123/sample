<div class="paragraph">
    <p class="text"><b><span>Sung Jin Woo</span> is a confident individual with a strong sense of family and a thirst for power. As a result, he is very close to his sister, mother, and Jinho, and rarely wastes an opportunity to grow stronger.

        It should also be noted that despite being the strongest hunter in the world, Jinwoo is not particularly arrogant and is both polite and easygoing in-person. He is also mostly indifferent to materialistic desires such as fame and fortune and can be very selfless, as displayed when he teleported to Jeju Island without a second thought to save the Korean raid team from certain death. In battle, however, he is ruthless, slaughtering his enemies indiscriminately, and even somewhat disdainful, as displayed when he taunted the Ant King for being an insect and mocked the Architect for his flawed design of the System.</b></p>

<div class="paragraph2">
    <p class="text2"><b><span>Monkey D. Luffy</span> is the leader of the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy has always had dreams of being a pirate thanks to the influence of his hero Red-Haired Shanks. To succeed Gol D. Roger as "King of the Pirates," 17-year-old Luffy sets out from the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the fabled treasure One Piece.

        On his voyage, he faces enemies, helps locals on several islands, and develops friendships with them. Normally jovial, when he fights he turns serious and even hostile. Luffy executes a variety of blows by concentrating his power and using his elasticity. Gum-Gum Pistol, his hallmark move, involves him slingshotting punches at adversaries from a distance.Above all else, Luffy dislikes weak people, though not strictly in a physical sense. He has openly told Koby that he "hates people like him" due to Koby's frequent use of phrases of "it's impossible" and his cowardly nature. Conversely, he likes people who put in the effort to make something of themselves, despite their limitations, and has come to appreciate Koby after seeing him put his life on the line. He calls out Kuro for complaining about being a pirate, taking less issue with his crimes and more with his desire to escape the life of being a pirate.</b></p>

<div class="paragraph3">
    <p class="text3"><b><span>Zhuo Yifan</span> was the Demon Emperor. One day, he managed to lay his hands on an ancient emperor’s book, the Nine Serenities Secret Records. As the book was coveted by many, he was targeted by experts and was even betrayed by his student. This book allowed him to defy common sense and gain power like no other.

        Zhuo Yi-Fan decided to blow himself up including his soul along with the Nine Serenities Secret Scriptures, but he actually used one of the Nine Serenities Secret Scriptures techniques to separate his soul and possess the body of a boy owned by a Clan servant of the Luo Clan named Zhuo Fan 5000 years later.His goals are to surpass his past life’s cultivation realm and take vengeance against the Sacred Saint and seven Emperors of the Sacred Domain.</b></p>

<div class="paragraph4">
<p class="text4"><b><span>Daniel</span> was raised by a single mom, and they lived in poverty. In addition to his poor living conditions, Daniel was looked down upon due to his appearance, leading him to be bullied at school (mostly by Logan)

    No longer willing to put up with the bullying, Daniel's mother offered him a chance to transfer to a different school (Jae Won High). Daniel, unable to bear with his school troubles any longer, tearfully accepted.
    
    Upon moving, Daniel's dreams of starting anew were quickly shattered by a humiliating defeat at the hands of Zack Lee, captured on video. With the video going viral, he cried himself to sleep only to awaken the next morning in a completely new body.</b></p>

The South Korean government had him attempt to assassinate the North Korean Supreme Leader again in order for him to leave his post.</b></p>
